## Additional Resources + Bibliography

“Calculate d from n, e, p, q in RSA?” Stack Overflow, stackoverflow.com/questions/23279208/calculate-d-from-n-e-p-q-in-rsa. (This JavaScript code helps calculate the modular inverse using an iterative algorithm for the RSA algorithm.)

“Calculate Modular Exponentiation (PowerMod) in Javascript (a^p % n).” Syed Umar Anis, 13 July 2018, umaranis.com/2018/07/12/calculate-modular-exponentiation-powermod-in-javascript-ap-n/. (This helped with modular exponentiation without access to big numbers in JavaScript.)

“Check a Number Is Prime or Not Using JavaScript.” GeeksforGeeks, 15 July 2019, www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-a-number-is-prime-or-not-using-javascript/. (This was useful for automating the RSA calculation and efficiently checking if numbers p and q were prime when the user chose them.)

crashcourse. “Cryptography: Crash Course Computer Science #33.” YouTube, YouTube, 25 Oct. 2017, www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhXCTbFnK8o. (Used for general understanding of cryptography)

“Euler's Totient Function (Video).” Khan Academy, Khan Academy, www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography/modern-crypt/v/euler-s-totient-function-phi-function. (Used to understand Euler’s Totient Theorem - helpful in writing our own version of Euler Totient Theorem)

Hartnett, Kevin, and substantive Quanta Magazine moderates comments to facilitate an informed. “Mathematicians Seal Back Door to Breaking RSA Encryption.” Quanta Magazine, www.quantamagazine.org/mathematicians-seal-back-door-to-breaking-rsa-encryption-20181217/. (This was used for background on why factoring breaks RSA)

“JavaScript Math: Greatest Common Divisor (Gcd) of Two Integers.” w3resource, www.w3resource.com/javascript-exercises/javascript-math-exercise-8.php. (This site shows how to get a GCD for calculating coprimes in the RSA algorithm.)
