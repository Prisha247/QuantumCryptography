Euler's Totient Function, written as the phi function in the RSA algorithm, "measures the breakability of a number." 
Phi function = (p-1)(q-1) where p and q are prime numbers
Integral part of the RSA algorithm!
Phi function is used to come up with an encryption key (e) which is then used to come up with a decryption key!
