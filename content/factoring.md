  ### Math Behind The RSA Algorithm

  RSA involves a public key and private key. The public key can be known to everyone- it is used to encrypt messages. Messages encrypted using the public key can only be decrypted with the private key. The keys for the RSA algorithm are generated the following way:

  here will be an example of the algorithm in use, possibly with an animation, to make it easier for the viewer to understand. *ADD AN EXAMPLE*

  ### Future Steps
  introduce quantum cryptography, and urge the audience to go to the next page, where we will talk about shor's algorithm.
